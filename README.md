# FlaskLoginSystem
This is a simple login system using a Flask framework. In order to use this, you must do the following after cloning this repository:

1. Install Python (go here: https://www.python.org/downloads/). I used Python 3.8.3 when making this.
2. Install pip. This comes automatically with versions of Python after 3.4.
2. Install flask (run `pip install flask` in your command prompt/terminal in any directory).
3. Install passlib (run `pip install passlib` in your command prompt/terminal in any directory).
4. Change the secret key (see the comments above where the secret key is set in app.py).
5. Run your flask server! Type `flask run` in your command prompt/terminal and make sure that you are in the same directory as this flask app.

Enjoy, and thanks for visiting!
